      <h1>Introducing Elixir Response Snapshot Testing</h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;m excited to introduce an Elixir testing library that I&rsquo;ve been working on, as well
as to explain the general ideas behind it. The library is called Response Snapshot and
can be found on <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/response_snapshot" target="_blank">hex</a>. The work is based on
my <a href="https://github.com/SalesLoft/rspec-rcv" target="_blank">rspec-rcv</a> gem which provides a very similar
interface and seeks to achieve the same goals.</p>

</ul>

<h1>What is snapshot testing?</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m borrowing this term from Jest, but I think that the concept is fairly simple
and true to the name. Snapshot testing is testing an API response by collecting
a valid snapshot of the output and comparing future tests against it. The entire
API response can be asserted against with a single line of code, and visually verified
as correct by a human.</p>

<p>In addition to being able to quickly test response outputs and ensure their shape
doesn&rsquo;t change over time, the snapshots can be utilized by frontend specs or other
client systems as an example of valid output. If the frontend specs always use the
most recent snapshots, any changes to the backend which would break the frontend
should fail when the frontend specs run.</p>

<h1>Where does snapshot testing fall short?</h1>

<p>I would hazard a guess that the idea of snapshot testing makes TDD practitioners
cringe a bit. In particular, a human has to verify that the snapshot is accurate
and then commit that into source control. Humans are prone to errors and so this
could be considered worse than standard tests on a response. I do think that there
is a place for response assertions in addition to a snapshot, although snapshots
significantly lower the barrier to entry on testing responses. Without snapshot testing,
the tests for a response can end up being long, redundant, and a chore to update.</p>

<p>One of the big challenges in snapshot testing is handling values that change between
test runs. This is really common with ids, dates, and information generated from
a library like faker. ResponseSnapshot introduces an optional <code>:keys</code> mode which
will not error out if any values are modified. This is most useful when the shape
of the data should be asserted, but not the exact values. Addition and removal of
keys would be an error in this mode. Another solution to avoid using keys mode is
ignored keys. With this, specific path value changes can be ignored. Paths can be
absolute or wildcards.</p>

<h1>Getting started in Elixir</h1>

<p>To get started in Elixir, follow the <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/elixir_response_snapshot#installation" target="_blank">installation instructions</a>.
Capturing your first test involves invoking <code>store_and_compare!/2</code>. Let&rsquo;s see an
example:</p>

<pre><code>test &quot;widgets are listed out&quot;, %{conn: conn} do
  conn
  |&gt; get(&quot;/api/widgets&quot;)
  |&gt; json_response(200)
  |&gt; ResponseSnapshot.store_and_compare!(path: &quot;widgets/index.json&quot;)
end
</code></pre>

<p>In practice, you will want to setup your fixture path base and ignore keys that
change between test runs (such as ids and dates):</p>

<pre><code>config :response_snapshot,
  path_base: &quot;test/fixtures&quot;,
  ignored_keys: [
    {&quot;id&quot;, :any_nesting},
    {&quot;created_at&quot;, :any_nesting},
  ]
</code></pre>

<p>The output of the test run will be a fixture file located at <code>test/fixtures/widgets/index.json</code>.
This file will include the test file path, the recording time, and the JSON response
of the API.</p>

<h1>Next steps</h1>

<p>For next steps, I&rsquo;d like to bring some best practices to the library, such as using
Dialyzer. However, the core of the library seems to be operating as expected and includes
a lot of lessons learned from rspec-rcv over the past 2 years. Please reach out
on Github issues if you see anything you&rsquo;d like fixed or have any questions!</p>
