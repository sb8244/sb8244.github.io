      <h1>28 days of Elixir - Silly Mistakes I Make Again and Again</h1>
      <p>It&rsquo;s day 2 of my 28 days of Elixir blogging. I have 5 more ideas in the funnel, and I fear
that coming up with 28 interesting topics will be hard. I&rsquo;ll definitely be leaning on
co-workers for ideas, but don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if you have any interesting ideas
that you&rsquo;d want me to explore!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing Elixir daily at SalesLoft, and have gotten pretty quick with development
and testing of my apps. However, a few things just keep catching me up every time:</p>

<h2>Charlist and Strings</h2>

<p>In both Ruby and Javascript, it is acceptable to swap &lsquo; and &ldquo;  for strings, in many cases.
This means that &#39;a&rsquo; === &quot;a&rdquo; in Javascript. However, &lsquo;a&rsquo; != &ldquo;a&rdquo; in Elixir. This is due to
charlist and string being implemented differently. Charlist is often used for interfacing
with erlang directly, because erlang does not have the concept of &ldquo;strings&rdquo;.</p>

<p>One mistake I will often catch is swapping the usage of the quote constructs and then
doing equality or other comparisons, and being bewildered when the strings do not match.
Catching this error can be a bit tricky if the error message doesn&rsquo;t show you that the
types are different, but a usual symptom is being completely bewildered why two matching
strings are not matching. The most significant place to pay attention to is when interfacing
with code between libraries, as the target and source are separated.</p>

<h2>Running mix test on the source file</h2>

<p>This one is always a face-palmer. When running <code>mix test test/my_test.exs</code>, be careful of
accidentally copying a path like <code>mix test lib/my.ex</code>. The symptom of this mistake is a
passing spec suite which runs 0 specs, and complains about a re-defined module.</p>

<h2>Define a test file with the same name as the real module, rather than test</h2>

<p>My flow for creating a module is to create the source module (.ex), then running
(opt-g-t) to create a test script (.exs). I will then copy the source module definition
and add ExUnit and <code>Test</code> to the end of the module.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m going red/green on my code, I sometimes find myself shocked that a function
doesn&rsquo;t exist when I most certainly just defined it. After looking around wondering
what is going on, I realize I forgot to include <code>Test</code> at the end of the module. This
re-initializes the module (without real code) but is still a sementically valid
test file.</p>

<h2>Not recognizing pattern matching in test helpers such as assert received</h2>

<p>This is one of the more interesting / subtle mistakes that I find myself making. I especially
see this in older Elixir code that I wrote where I didn&rsquo;t fully understand what was
going on.</p>

<p>I will be doing a task like writing / testing a websocket channel and find that my
code passes perfectly when I know that it&rsquo;s definitely not working correctly. I will
be trying to make my code go red but simply can&rsquo;t make it. Usually, it turns out
that I&rsquo;m using a function like <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.ChannelTest.html#assert_push/3" target="_blank">assert_push/3</a>
that is actually a macro. The way these are written, the function is actually
doing pattern matching rather than exact checks. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>expected_payload = %{foo: &quot;bar&quot;}
assert_push &quot;some_event&quot;, expected_payload
</code></pre>

<p>is different than:</p>

<pre><code>expected_payload = %{foo: &quot;bar&quot;}
assert_push &quot;some_event&quot;, ^expected_payload
</code></pre>

<p>This is highlighted in the assert_push documentation, but essentially the first example
doesn&rsquo;t check that the payload is <em>exactly</em> the expected payload. This means that there could
be something like a data leak and our test wouldn&rsquo;t catch it! Pattern matching the responses
can be super useful, but make sure that it&rsquo;s happening when you expect it, and not
when you don&rsquo;t!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, today. Keep up through the month of February to see if I can
stand subjecting myself to <a href="/tags/28-days-of-elixir.html" target="_blank">28 days of straight writing</a>.</p>
