      <h1>28 days - Phoenix websocket dive</h1>
      <p>I, and seemingly most people that use them, have a positive view towards Phoenix
websockets. They are simple to use, scalable, and are stable in production. I have
some neat content that I want to go over with websockets, but it will be better
to do a deep dive into how they work first. In particular, the process structure
and how they scale.</p>

<p>I have prepared a demo repository that implements a few different websocket concepts.
The goal of this demo is to reinforce / provide material for this post. You can
find the repo on <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/websocket-demo/tree/66b7933157be16b4e6d03ab08e21fc9b9841882d" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>

<p>The beginning section will start with basics of the websocket, leading into
how the websocket internals work.</p>

<h2>Websocket Tests</h2>

<p>Before going into the code that powers the websocket, let&rsquo;s dive into the code that <em>tests</em>
the websocket. <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.ChannelTest.html" target="_blank">Phoenix.ChannelTest</a> provides
some helpers that make testing the socket simple. There is some complex setup that goes into the socket,
but these helpers reduce the complexity.</p>

<p>The first test that I like to start with is a test for <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/websocket-demo/blob/66b7933157be16b4e6d03ab08e21fc9b9841882d/test/websocket_demo_web/channels/demo_channel_test.exs#L10" target="_blank">joining a channel</a>.
A channel is an abstraction over the websocket to allow for the actual bi-directional communication. When
we &ldquo;communicate&rdquo; to a socket, we&rsquo;re actually communicating to the channel. It is good practice
to test that the socket is authenticated to join a particular channel, but this demo does not
use any authorization.</p>

<p>One of the very core behaviors of a websocket is responding to a request from the client.
This is <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/websocket-demo/blob/66b7933157be16b4e6d03ab08e21fc9b9841882d/test/websocket_demo_web/channels/demo_channel_test.exs#L45" target="_blank">tested</a>
using <code>assert_reply</code>, which ensures that the particular push to the websocket is responded to.
We will dig into what &ldquo;responding to a push&rdquo; means, below.</p>

<p>One test that I struggled a bit with was <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/websocket-demo/blob/66b7933157be16b4e6d03ab08e21fc9b9841882d/test/websocket_demo_web/channels/demo_channel_test.exs#L26" target="_blank">testing that the async timer was enqueued for 5 seconds</a>.
I started this test by making the test wait for 5s, which was really not a good strategy. What
I ended with was keep the timer reference in a state variable, and reading that from the test. It
might not be great to reach into the internals of a structure in a test, but the alternative is
waiting a very long time in the test suite. I ended up being okay with this tradeoff for the
delayed push test, as I could easily make it run in less time by changing from 300ms to
something else.</p>

<p>You can find the implementation that satisfies these tests <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/websocket-demo/blob/66b7933157be16b4e6d03ab08e21fc9b9841882d/lib/websocket_demo_web/channels/demo_channel.ex" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Behind the scenes, what is a websocket?</h2>

<p>The real purpose of this post is to explore what a websocket is. Specifically, what
is happening when connection, pushes, and responses happen. Let&rsquo;s start by looking at
the process structure for when a websocket is created. I will do this by opening
<code>:observer.start</code> and looking at the difference when a socket is created.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/images/websocket-dive/one-socket.png" alt="one socket appears in the process tree" />
  <div>
    <small>
      <i>The rightmost process is the websocket process</i>
    </small>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Above, the pid <0.369.0> is the websocket process. This is possible to visualize by
clicking on that process and viewing the state. It shows the websocket internal state.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/images/websocket-dive/369-socket.png" alt="pid 369 appears clearly as the socket" />
  <div>
    <small>
      <i>It is possible to view the Socket struct in the state information</i>
    </small>
  </div>
</div>

<p>One interesting thing about this pid is that it appears in the state itself, as the
<code>channel_pid</code> key of the Elixir.Phoenix.Socket struct. As if seeing the process in
observer is not enough, this gives the proof that the channel is a process.</p>

<p>Also in the process state is a second pid called <code>transport_pid</code>. This process is where
the actual websocket protocol occurs.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/images/websocket-dive/transport-process.png" alt="the transport process information" />
  <div>
    <small>
      <i>The transport process is the parent of the channel process</i>
    </small>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Internally, there is a <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/lib/phoenix/channel/server.ex#L186" target="_blank"><code>Phoenix.Channel.Server</code></a>
GenServer which wraps around the behavior of the defined channel. I initially thought
that saying <code>use Phoenix.Channel</code> would cause the channel to become a GenServer, but
that is proved false by seeing that the Phoenix.Channel.Server implementation sets
<code>channel_pid: self()</code>. I won&rsquo;t dig into this server implementation today.</p>

<p>I also won&rsquo;t dig into the cowboy code, but we can see that the actual websocket
implementation happens at the cowboy level via <a href="https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.0/manual/cowboy_websocket/" target="_blank">cowboy_websocket</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the PubSub.Local0 process is monitoring the channel process. I am going to leave
this implementation up for another blog post, or as an exercise for you.</p>

<h2>Websocket messages</h2>

<p>Google Chrome provides functionality to view what a websocket is doing. This can be
accessed by finding the websocket in the Network tab. The websocket request has a
&ldquo;frames&rdquo; inner section. When you view this, you may need to drag down the &ldquo;select a frame&rdquo;
content to view the frames themselves.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/images/websocket-dive/frontend-messages.png" alt="frontend message frames" />
  <div>
    <small>
      <i>The in/out of the client websocket</i>
    </small>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When a message is pushed from the JS client to the backend, it sends the request in the format
<code>[join_ref, message_ref, topic, message, payload]</code>. The join<em>ref and message</em>ref are actually
really important. These are used in the response (same format as the request) to allow calling
back to the right function. Phoenix provides the <code>reply</code> function to reply to a <code>socket_ref</code>.
The demo uses this to <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/websocket-demo/blob/66b7933157be16b4e6d03ab08e21fc9b9841882d/lib/websocket_demo_web/channels/demo_channel.ex#L26" target="_blank">reply asynchronously</a>
to requests. Asynchronous replies must happen within the channel timeout period (10s default). A
timeout event will trigger if it is not in that timeframe. It is possible to override this timeframe
to be whatever you need for your use case.</p>

<p>The two refs can be null, as seen for the tick message. This will cause it to
be a global message handler rather than a local one.</p>

<h2>What are the benefits of a channel / transport process?</h2>

<p>The process structure of Phoenix websockets is one of the things that helps make it
fault tolerant. Let&rsquo;s say that something goes wrong with the channel process and causes
it to crash. The process will be started back up from the supervisor, causing the
<code>join</code> function to be called (triggering any join callbacks on the client). However,
the channel crash does not cause the client to see any fault in the socket it has.</p>

<p>If the transport process crashes, the client sees a disconnection and will try to reconnect.
The channel process also restarts, because it is a child of the transport process. In this
scenario, the system ends in a stable operating state.</p>

<p>A benefit of the channel process is that the process can be controlled like any other process.
It can handle messages via a <code>handle_info</code> callback, which the demo uses to create a
tick every 5 seconds. It can also store arbitrary state (best practice is the assigns
map) which can be used to like any other GenServer state.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have a few different things that are more advanced than an intro to websocket post. My
current ideas are how to debounce a websocket push (push once every X seconds) and also
what happens to setup the websocket requests.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading the 10th post in my 28 days of Elixir. Keep up through the month of February to see if I can
stand subjecting myself to <a href="/tags/28-days-of-elixir.html" target="_blank">28 days of straight writing</a>. I
am looking for new topics to write about, so please reach out if there&rsquo;s anything you
really want to see!</p>
