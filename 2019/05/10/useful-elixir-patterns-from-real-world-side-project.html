      <h1>Useful Elixir Patterns from Real-world Side Project</h1>
      <p>I believe that one of the best ways to push new practices is to work on a real-world project that we
can afford to experiment on. We can push the boundary in the toy project while still seeing the results
of the decisions in a production environment with real users. I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to be able to ship
several applications like this at SalesLoft. The latest one that we&rsquo;ll look at today is our internal OKR (Objective-Key Result) app that we use for goal tracking and alignment.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll walk through this project and see several different patterns that I like. Some of these patterns
have been used in several different projects of mine and have held up well. Others were new experiments
that I hope to use again in the future.</p>

<p>The source code for the application can be found on <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub" target="_blank">Github</a>. The useful
part is the code and tests, less so the specific functionality.</p>

<h1>Context Usage</h1>

<p>Contexts, at least as I use them, are all about establishing an application domain and keeping
the interfaces small and useful for other parts of the system to use. I&rsquo;ve done this in the past but
really pushed it for this project by having no function usage other than top level modules. This
pattern allows us to have a well-defined interface for the application, which makes it simpler for both
us and others to modify the code and understand the consequences.</p>

<p>As an example, the following would not be acceptable:</p>

<pre><code class="elixir">MyApp.SomeContext.ASpecificQuery.execute(params)
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, I would prefer this:</p>

<pre><code class="elixir">MyApp.SomeContext.a_query(params)
</code></pre>

<p>All of my contexts live under the <code>OkrApp</code> module. You can see a list of them in the <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/tree/master/lib/okr_app" target="_blank">okr_app folder</a>.</p>

<p>I started off the application by writing code directly in the context. Some of this is still seen because
I didn&rsquo;t go back through and change everything once I solidified on what I wanted. In the end, I found
that <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app/analytics.ex#L5" target="_blank">function delegates</a>
allowed the context to be very easy to digest and I could write tests for the underlying modules in distinct
files.</p>

<p>The hardest part of this pattern, that I haven&rsquo;t figured out yet, is how to handle Ecto schemas between
contexts. Sometimes, a context needs to leak out. For example, a <code>User</code> schema may need to be referenced
by the <code>AnalyticsEvent</code> schema (as seen <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app/analytics/analytics_event.ex#L11" target="_blank">here</a>).
I found this acceptable because I wasn&rsquo;t invoking logic outside of the context interface.</p>

<p>The advantage of Context came out when I built the <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/tree/master/lib/okr_app/mailer" target="_blank">mailer</a>.
I found it very simple to add in this new code without worrying about anything breaking. I was also to extract concepts
specific to the mailer (such as <code>Recipient</code>) rather than relying on generic modules prone to change such as <code>User</code>.</p>

<h1>Isolated Logic (Context) for SCIM</h1>

<p>One of the requirements for this project was SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management). We use Okta internally and
they have a lot of docs on how to write a SCIM integration. I didn&rsquo;t want the details of SCIM leaking into the system too
heavily. I was able to leverage a SCIM Context to achieve this goal in a way that I am pretty satisfied with.</p>

<p>SCIM has all of its web functionality extracted into a module called <code>Scim.Web</code>. <code>Phoenix.Router</code> is used to provide the
appropriate endpoint definitions, but the integration happens in a simple <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/scim/web/plug.ex#L13" target="_blank">Plug</a>
which is used by <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app_web/router.ex#L43" target="_blank"><code>OkrAppWeb.Router</code></a>.</p>

<p>The entire <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/scim/web/users_controller.ex#L9" target="_blank">SCIM controller</a> leverages
a behavior passed into it. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern" target="_blank">strategy pattern</a> at work.
I didn&rsquo;t create a specific <code>Behaviour</code> requirement for this module but probably should have, because it has an expected
interface.</p>

<p>The actual SCIM application integration happens in <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app/users_scim.ex" target="_blank">UsersScim</a>.
This code is a bit ugly since I didn&rsquo;t clean it up too much, but it&rsquo;s nice that the implementation doesn&rsquo;t leak into my
application API nor does it leak into other contexts.</p>

<h1>ListQuery Module</h1>

<p>I really like Ecto&rsquo;s API for querying data, but I have found it cumbersome to build up dynamic queries from API params easily.
I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app/query/list_query.ex" target="_blank"><code>ListQuery</code></a> some time ago that I brought into this project.</p>

<p>The ListQuery is used to take provided <code>params</code> and <code>opts</code> and turns it into an Ecto compatible query. Sometimes advanced
queries are required and I devised a small way to do that by stripping certain <code>params</code> and then reapplying them. You can
see that <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app/objectives/store/cycle_store.ex#L11" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m able to leverage a <code>ListQuery</code> powered function in <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app_web/controllers/api/objective_link_controller.ex#L11" target="_blank">various controllers</a>
by passing in the user params. If you use this pattern in an environment with non-friendly users, you should probably sanitize
the input to not leak any information to the client.</p>

<h1>SimpleEctoStore Module</h1>

<p>My contexts use <code>defdelegate</code> to send queries to a different module. I called the module a &ldquo;store&rdquo; and found myself
<a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app/objectives.ex#L13" target="_blank">delegating to them often</a>.
Writing the same code again and again in the store became a bit cumbersome. Often, I would be writing the most
simple code possible with just the module name changed.</p>

<p>My solution to this copy/paste problem was to build a macro powered <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app/store/simple_ecto_store.ex" target="_blank"><code>SimpleEctoStore</code></a>.
Each usage of <code>SimpleEctoStore</code> involved passing in the schema module as well as what methods were desired to be
pulled in. You can see this <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app/objectives/store/objective_link_store.ex#L2" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>This allowed me to remove the boiler plate for a large number of ecto stores. If I used a concept like stores again,
I would definitely repeat this one.</p>

<h1>Things that didn&rsquo;t work as well</h1>

<p>One of the biggest pain points I had was defining how I wanted my JSON API to work. At work, I follow the philosophy of very focused
endpoints that don&rsquo;t preload many models together. This is for performance and flexibility reasons. Doing that in this project
made it much more complex for me and was going to take time that I didn&rsquo;t want to spend. The end result here is that I
have a massive endpoint called &ldquo;Okr&rdquo; that <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app_web/serializers/okr.ex" target="_blank">embeds many associations</a>.</p>

<p>The preload for my Okr endpoint is <a href="https://github.com/sb8244/okr_app_pub/blob/master/lib/okr_app/objectives/okr_preloader.ex" target="_blank">pretty gnarly</a> as
well. However, I was thrilled to be able to pass queries into the preload clauses which means that I removed the risk of
accidentally leaking data that is queried out of the system but then not handled properly by me in Elixir.</p>

<p>Another thing that I still feel awkward about is a context&rsquo;s schema referencing a different context&rsquo;s schema. I wanted to
remove this but couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to do so in a way I liked.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Contexts allowed for a focused API between parts of an application. Using them saved me some mental gymnastics as I was
developing the application. I was particularly happy with how I was able to isolate the sort of whacky SCIM API via
focused context modules.</p>

<p><code>ListQuery</code> and <code>SimpleEctoStore</code> both made my life easier while defining my ecto based queries and stores. These are generically
applicable modules that could be brought into other applications if needed.</p>

<p>I am really happy overall with how this project turned out. It is easy to read through nearly 6 months after I&rsquo;ve originally
built it and has been running without any Elixir issues since that time. I&rsquo;ll be applying these patterns to future projects,
for sure, and hope you are able to get some value from it!</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for reading! I&rsquo;ll be teaching a class at ElixirConf US about building scalable real-time systems in Elixir. I&rsquo;ve been
focused a lot on this topic so I&rsquo;m pretty thrilled to share what I&rsquo;ve learned. I believe that registration will open
soon.</p>
